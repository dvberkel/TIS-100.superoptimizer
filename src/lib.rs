//! > Supertoptimization for TIS-100 game
//!
//! ## Goal
//! This project contains code that attempts to super-optimize certain
//! programming tasks for TIS-100.
//!
//! ### TIS-100
//! Developed by [Zachary Barth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachary_Barth)
//! under the banner of [Zachtronics Industries](http://www.zachtronics.com/),
//! [TIS-100](http://www.zachtronics.com/tis-100/) is a
//!
//! > open-ended programming game in which you rewrite corrupted code segments to
//! > repair the TIS-100 and unlock its secrets. Itâ€™s the assembly language
//! > programming game you never asked for!
//!
//! ### Super-optimization
//! Wikipedia defines
//! [super-optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superoptimization) as
//!
//! > Superoptimization is the task of finding the optimal code sequence for a
//! > single, loop-free sequence of instructions
