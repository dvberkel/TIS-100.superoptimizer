# TIS-100.superoptimizer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dvberkel/TIS-100.superoptimizer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dvberkel/TIS-100.superoptimizer)
Super-optimization for [TIS-100][tis-100] game.

## Goal
This repository contains code that attempts to super-optimize certain
programming tasks for TIS-100.

### TIS-100
Developed by [Zachary Barth][zachary] under the banner of
[Zachtronics Industries][zachtronics], [TIS-100][tis-100] is a

> open-ended programming game in which you rewrite corrupted code segments to
> repair the TIS-100 and unlock its secrets. Itâ€™s the assembly language
> programming game you never asked for!

### Super-optimization
Wikipedia defines [super-optimization][] as

> Superoptimization is the task of finding the optimal code sequence for a
> single, loop-free sequence of instructions 

## Documentation
The [documentation][] is hosted as a [GitHub pages][gh-pages] and is
automatically updated with every push to the repository.
